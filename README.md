# Snake-in-Rust
A simple interactive Snake game, created using the Rust programming language and implementing Piston. 
I have used multiple libraries for the UI and data structures for the basic body structure and various commands for movement of the character.
Piston Window has been used for the implementation of the game, as the base open source game engine.

Shortcomings - 
- The spawn location of first food remains the same everytime.
- The spawn location of the snake will have to be changed from the source code (if needed).
